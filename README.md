# Dungeon-Crawler
### Dungeon Crawler is a text based, dungeon crawling rogue-like adventure being built in Python!

It is still relatively early in development, but the goal is for this project to simulate an endless dungeon that is different every playthrough. 
There are plans for multiple player classes, enemy types, events, environments, and more.

### How to play

#### Open a terminal in the root of the directory and install the dependencies:
`
pip install -r requirements.txt
`
#### Then simply:
`
python play.py
`
#### Feel free to make a pull request with changes to any of the code.
